# Programming task for All Out 

## tools used

the only tool I used was React and the api

## Command needed to run 

`npm i` this will download all the needed dependecies
`npm start` will start up a server


## How to use and what to avoid 

 1. input text wanted to be translated 
 2. select target language to be tranlated to 
 3. click translate  and poof it should be tranlated 

 **AVOID**

 do not hit tranlate without sleceting a language this will cause it to crash
